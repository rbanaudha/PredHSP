<p>In this letter, I plan to discuss Your Website's pigheaded
long-term goals quite extensively. Note that the details aren't
pleasant. In fact, they're shocking. But I think that people who
don't know what Your Website is up to surely need to be shocked.
But before I continue, allow me to explain that I must ask that
Your Website's comrades focus on what unites rather than divides
us. I know they'll never do that, so here's an alternate
proposal: They should, at the very least, back off and quit
trying to pilfer the national treasure. Why is Your Website
really so boisterous? Is it because I've catalogued all of its
foibles -- and the list is pretty big? Or because it functions
not as a social critic, but as an unoriginal imitator of the
ruling ideologues? This can be answered most easily by stating
that if it wants to be taken seriously, it should counter the
arguments in this letter with facts, not illogical panaceas,
personal anecdotes, or insults. In such a brief letter as this, I
certainly cannot refute all the revenge fantasies of
presumptuous, blathering fanatics, but perhaps I can brush away
some of their most deliberate and flagrant commentaries.</p>
<p>What does Your Website have to say about all of this? The
answer, as expected, is nothing. Your Website frequently avers
its support of democracy and its love of freedom. But one need
only look at what Your Website is doing -- as opposed to what it
is saying -- to understand its true aims.</p>
<p>I could go on and on about Your Website's special form of
classism, but you get the general idea. Contrast, for example,
Your Website's hijinks with those of the most craven galoots I've
ever seen, and observe that there <em>is</em> no contrast. I, by
(genuine) contrast, take the view that if Your Website thinks
that all minorities are poor, stupid ghetto trash, then it's
sadly mistaken. Does anybody else feel the way I do, or am I
alone in my disgust with Your Website?</p>
